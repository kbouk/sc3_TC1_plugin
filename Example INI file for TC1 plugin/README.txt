This is the ini file that should be located the at /home/sysop/seiscomp3/var/lib/seedlink/ directory
and called from /home/sysop/seiscomp3/var/lib/seedlink/seedlink.ini
A similar ini file is created automatically when a station with the minilogger_plugin is declared in SeisComP3, but it need to have these setup values in order
for the TC1 plugin to work (ofcourse you define your own station and network name).
